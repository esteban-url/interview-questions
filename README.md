# Weekly problems

A series of short and fun problems to solve in javascript. I get them on my email from the [rendezvous with cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) newsletter.

Each problem is in a separate folder, with these files:

- `README.md` contains the problem description.
- `*.ts` contains the solution(s) in typescript.
- `*.test.ts` contains the tests for the solution(s).

## Installation

1. clone the repo

2. ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

## Testing

```sh
yarn test
```
