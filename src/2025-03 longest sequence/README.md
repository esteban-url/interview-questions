# longest sequence

Given a list of integers, write a function that finds the longest subsequence where the difference between consecutive elements is either 1 or -1. Return the length of this subsequence.

## Example

```js
> longestSubsequence([1,2,3,4,5])
5
> longestSubsequence([4,2,3,1,5])
2
> longestSubsequence([10,11,7,8,9,12])
3
```
